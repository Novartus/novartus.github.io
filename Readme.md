# Portfolio v2 ✨

## Philosophy: Back to Basics
Welcome to the second iteration of my personal portfolio. In a world dominated by heavy JavaScript frameworks, this project takes a different approach.

**v2 is built entirely without frameworks.**

I chose to use **semantic HTML5**, **modern CSS3**, and **Vanilla JavaScript** to demonstrate that you don't need a complex stack to build a performant, accessible, and beautiful website. This ensures maximum performance, SEO optimization, and a lightweight footprint.

## 🚀 Features
- **Zero Dependencies**: Pure HTML, CSS, and JS.
- **100/100 Performance**: Blazing fast load times.
- **SEO Optimized**: Comprehensive Meta tags, JSON-LD Structured Data, Sitemap, and Robots.txt included.
- **Accessible (a11y)**: Built with screen readers in mind (ARIA labels, semantic tags).
- **Responsive**: Fluid design that works on all devices to provide a great user experience.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure for better accessibility and SEO.
- **CSS3**: Modern styling using Variables, Flexbox, and Grid.
- **JavaScript**: Minimal, efficient code for interactivity.

## 🏃‍♂️ Running Locally
Since this is a static site, you don't need `npm install` or a build step!

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Novartus/portfolio.git
   ```

2. **Open the site:**
   - Simply double-click `index.html` to open it in your browser.
   - **OR** serve it with a static server (recommended):
     ```bash
     # Python 3
     python3 -m http.server
     
     # Node.js (http-server)
     npx http-server .
     ```

3. **Visit:** `http://localhost:8000` (port may vary based on your server).
